1. I developed this application using Spring Boot 
2. Default user data will be stored in session
3. Assumption default list will not be editable 
4. Only user data will be editable
5. If add @Primary annotation on  AccountDAO  class and @Primary annotation commented  on SessionDAO class
then user values will be stored on Embedded hsql database 
6. I deploy the war file in tomcat 8.0.3 and tested it is working fine
